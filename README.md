# Recycling Rate Project

The code here is used in the fish recycling rate paper by Thomas Jones, Matthew Jones, Melissa Treml, and Thomas Heinrich titled Estimating Recycling of Fish in Catch-and-Release Fisheries.

Of particular importance is the script called plausible_catchability.py, where anyone can enter a potential selectivity distribution and compare the true recycling rate to the estimate from the various models presented in the paper.
